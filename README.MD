# what does cpuG do?

cpuG is a bash script made to automate cpufrequtils.
It helps you by listing your cpu's clocksteps and available governors making it easier for you to make changes with the minimum user interaction possible. (If you ever used cpufrequtils you know what I'm talking about).

Dependency: cpufrequtils

    $sudo apt-get install cpufrequtils

Usage (as root):

    $sudo ./cpuG

For any feature/enhancement request feel free to open an issue, I'll add it for you.
